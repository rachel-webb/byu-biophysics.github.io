Gus Hart is a professor in BYU's Department of Physics and Astronomy. He came to BYU from Northern Arizona in 2006. He completed a PhD at UC Davis with [Barry Klein](https://physics.ucdavis.edu/directory/faculty/barry-klein) in 1999 and a postdoctoral appointment at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in 2001 with [Alex Zunger](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/zunger-matter-by-design/alex-zunger).

Until 2022, Gus's research was computational materials physics where his focus was on alloy modeling, algorithm development, and [aflowlib.org](https://aflowlib.org/). He is the author of [enumlib](https://github.com/msg-byu/enumlib), [symlib](https://github.com/msg-byu/symlib), and [other open source codes](https://github.com/msg-byu). He is the primary developer of the commercial [UNCLE cluster expansion](https://www.materialsdesign.com/datasheet/uncle) code. 

Since 2022, Gus's research focus has shifted to data science and computational biophysics, with a particular focus on developing AI for bacterial tomograms.

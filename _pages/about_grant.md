Grant Jensen is a scientist and biochemistry professor serving as the dean of the College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at BYU. He earned his doctorate at Stanford University, where he worked on electron microscopy of RNA polymerase and other protein complexes with [Dr. Roger Kornberg](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2006/kornberg/facts/), a Nobel prize winner for structural studies of transcription. 

His research has since grown to include cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET). He spent 18 years as a professor of biology and biophysics at Caltech, where he studied the ultrastructure of small cells, the structural biology of HIV, and the development of cryo-EM technology. 

Together with his colleagues, Grant has published nearly 200 papers. He's passionate about creating free online sources for people to learn about cryo-EM, which is why he's created a free online textbook, the [Atlas of Bacterial and Archaeal Cell Structure](https://www.cellstructureatlas.org/), which is full of stunning tomograms and basic biology, and a free online course, [Getting Started in Cryo-EM](https://cryo-em-course.caltech.edu/), which teaches the fundamentals of cryogenic electron microscopy.

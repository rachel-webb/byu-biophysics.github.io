Stefano joined the Jensen lab as a postdoc in 2021, following Dr. Jensen from Caltech to BYU in 2022. Originally from Castel Goffredo in Mantua, Italy, Stefano received a bachelor’s degree in biology, a master’s degree in molecular biology, and a PhD in drugs, biomolecules, and health products from the University of Parma in Parma, Italy. Stefano is an expert in molecular biology, microscopy, and protein modeling, all of which allow him to solve the structure of biological machines in situ. He helps with any biological questions the biophysics group has and provides the tomograms that make up our datasets. Outside of the group, his current project focuses on electron cryo-tomography characterization of type IV pili machines and type IV secretion systems. 

In addition to imaging the microbial world, Stefano turns his photography skills to the skies, photographing galaxies, star clusters, and nebulae. He’s also skilled with manual transmissions—a side effect of growing up with a mechanic for a father—and loves motorcycles.
